## Installation
Installing FunkeySelectorGUI depends on the executable you are using.
### OpenFK
To use FunkeySelectorGUI with OpenFK, simply place the executable in the RadicaGame directory. You will need to open FunkeySelectorGUI alongside OpenFK at the moment. OpenFK's customF mode supports FunkeySelectorGUI well.
### UBFunkeys.exe
To use FunkeySelectorGUI with the original UBFunkeys.exe, rename the FunkeySelectorGUI.exe to MegaByte.exe and place it into the MegaByte folder. When you launch U.B. Funkeys, FunkeySelectorGUI will open along with it.

## Build
You can use Visual Studio or any other IDEs that can compile dotNET 4.0 .sln files to compile FunkeySelectorGUI.
FunkeySelectorGUI uses Microsoft dotNET 4.0 due to its Windows XP support.
